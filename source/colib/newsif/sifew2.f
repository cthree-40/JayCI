c  nipv = number of integers per value.
c       = 1 four orbital labels are packed in each labels(*) entry.
c       = 2 two orbital labels are packed in each labels(*) entry.
c       = 4 one orbital label is stored in each labels(*) entry.
c  num = actual number of values to place in the packed buffer.
c  last = integral continuation parameter.
c  itypea,itypeb = generic and specific integral types.
c  ifmt = format to use for the packed buffer.
c  ibvtyp = type of packed bit-vector.

c           note: if ifmt=0, then as many as ((nipv*n2max+7)/8)*8
c                 elements of labels(*) are referenced.
c  ibitv(*) = unpacked bit vector (referenced only if ibvtyp.ne.0).
c             note: as many as ((n1max+63)/64)*64 elements of this
c                   array are referenced.
c  iwait   = asynchronous i/o parameter.
c          = 0  don't wait.  use asynch i/o and return without
c               waiting for i/o completion.  the calling program
c               must call sif2w8() before reusing the buffer or
c               before calling this routine again with the same
c               output buffer.
c          = 1  wait for i/o completion before returning.
c               no sif2w8() call is required in the calling program.
c               buffer(*) can be reused immediately upon return.

c  output:
c  num = reset to the number of unwritten elements in values(*).
c        if (last.ne.0) then num is always zero on return. otherwise,
c        the calling program should not assume that this is set to zero.
c        note: this provision is to allow future data-dependent
c              value(*) and labels(*) packing methods. use:
c                   numtot = numtot + num
c                   call (...num...)
c                   numtot = numtot - num
c        in the calling program to compute correctly the total
c        number of output values.  -rls
c  values(1:num) = elements that were not written on this call.
c  labels(1:nipv,1:num) = corresponding unwritten labels.
c  ibitv(1:num) = corresponding unwritten bit-vector elements.
c  buffer(1:l2rec) = packed  buffer.
c  nrec = updated record count.
c         note: the calling program should not assume that this is
c               always incremented by 1.
c  reqnum = i/o request number for the i/o operation associated with
c           this record.
c  ierr = error return code.  0 for normal return.
