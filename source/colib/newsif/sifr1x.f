c
c  this is a no-frills routine to read generic integral arrays.
c
c  input:
c  aoints = input file unit number.
c  info(*) = info array for this file.
c  itypea, itypeb = generic and specific integral type to be read.
c                   if itypea>=0, then search the entire 1-e integral
c                                 file for candidates.  the file is
c                                 left positioned at the end of the
c                                 1-e integral records.
c                   if itypea<0,  then read the next single array only.
c                                 the file is not repositioned before
c                                 the read.
c                                 the file is left positioned at the end
c                                 of this array.
c  nsym = number of symmetry blocks.
c  nbpsy(*) = number of basis functions per symmetry block.
c  symoff(*) = symmetry block offsets used for nontotally symmetric
c              operators.  This includes itypea=1 and itypea=2 arrays.
c              the symmetry blocks within array(*) are offset by
c              symoff( nndxf(isym) + jsym). this allows compact
c              storage of sparse nonsymmetric operator matrices.
c              itypea=0 arrays are referenced in the normal manner,
c              and symoff(*) is not used.
c  buffer(1:l1rec) = record buffer.
c  values(1:n1max) = value buffer.
c  labels(1:2,1:n1max) = orbital label buffer.
c  mapin(*) = input_ao-to-ao mapping vector.
c  lena = length of array(*).
c  array(1:lena) = initial values for the integral array.
c  fcore = initial value for the frozen core contribution.
c
c  output:
c  symb(1:nbft) = symmetry index of each basis function.
c  array(*) = designated 1-e integral array (only if ierr = 0).
c             symmetry block order is determined by the symoff(*) array.
c             diagonal symmetry blocks are stored lower-triangle packed
c             by rows.  off-diagonal symmetry blocks are stored in
c             standard column order.
c  fcore = updated with core contributions from the designated arrays.
c  kntin(*) = number of elements read in each symmetry block.  this
c              array is always referenced as ( nndxf(isym) + jsym ).
c  lasta, lastb = last integral type read and used.
c  last = last parameter from the last record read.
c  ierr = error return code.
c       =  0     for normal return.
c       = -1     eof was found on aoints.
c       = -2     unsatisfied search.
c       = -n*100 if n symmetry blocking errors were detected.
c       >  0     iostat error while reading aoints..
