 civector.dat - Output file. This file contains the final CI vectors for all
                roots. Its format is as follows:
                %d %d %d (total electrons, total orbitals, total determinants)
                %d       (number of roots)
                [Empty Line]
                -- Repeated for N roots --
                %15.8lf  (Eigenvalue of root N)
                [Empty Line]
                %15.8lf  (Element i of root N eigenvector)
                [Empty Line]
